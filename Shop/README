Simple shopping program

This program have 2 item template so all function can be used without adding an item first.
this program will have 4 function
1. See item
   Simple looping through the item struct
2. Add item
   Adding item using for loop. User input how many item they want to input and loop where i = length so
   the loop will start at the end of the array and loop until length + userInput. so if the user want to input 
   2 item in an array of 5 item
   i = 5; i < 5+2; i++
3. Delete Item
    User input what item they want to delete. Using linear search we searh through the array, and if the array[i] is the same
    as user input, we take the index of that array and then we change that array to array[i+1]
4. exit
    Exit the program
